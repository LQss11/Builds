## About The Project
When it comes to learning and understanding new languages/frameworks/libraries... It usually frustrates me and starts to feel overwhelmed until I just give up, so I decided to make this repo open to everyone to use whenever they want to start **coding** **building** or **testing** that kind of applications.

Through each project, I will do my best to be following the best practices and try to containerize those projects using docker for people who don't want to waste time on env setup.

### Prerequisites
As said in the previous section we will mostly focus on containerizing those apps but you will find a `README.md` file on each one of those apps explaining how to set them up on your machine.
